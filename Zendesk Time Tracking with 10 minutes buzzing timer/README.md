## Description

This Tampermonkey script enhances the ticket management experience on Zendesk by providing time tracking for each ticket and playing a buzzing sound every 10 minutes to help users stay focused.

**Features:**

- **Time Tracking:** The script keeps track of the time spent working on each Zendesk ticket. It displays the elapsed time in a floating box that can be conveniently moved around the screen.

- **Buzzing Sound:** To maintain productivity, the script plays a short buzzing sound every 10 minutes, acting as a gentle reminder for users to stay attentive and focused.

## How to Use

1. Install a userscript manager like Tampermonkey in your web browser.

2. Copy the script code from the repository: [Zendesk-Ticket-Time-Tracking.js](https://github.com/your-username/Zendesk-Ticket-Time-Tracking/blob/main/Zendesk-Ticket-Time-Tracking.js).

3. Create a new Tampermonkey script by clicking on the Tampermonkey extension icon and selecting "Create a new script."

4. Paste the script code into the Tampermonkey script editor.

5. Replace `'https://your-zendesk-domain.zendesk.com/*'` with your actual Zendesk domain in the `@match` directive.

6. Save the script by clicking the "File" menu and selecting "Save" or pressing `Ctrl + S`.

7. The script is now active on your Zendesk domain. Open any Zendesk ticket, and you'll see the time tracking floating box in the top-right corner. The buzzing sound will play every 10 minutes while you are working on a ticket.

**Note:**

- The script may require the browser to allow autoplaying audio for the buzzing sound to work correctly.
